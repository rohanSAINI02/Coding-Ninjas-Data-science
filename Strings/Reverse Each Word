Where N is the length of the input string.

All the words in string are separated by a single space.

String does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.

SOLUTION:

def reverseEachWord(string) :
	# Your code goes here

	word = string.split()
	li = []

		li.append(i[::-1])
	result = " ".join(li)
	return(result)
