Input format :
The first line contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the array/list.

The second line contains 'N' single space separated integers representing the elements in the array/list.
Output Format :
Return the second largest element in the array/list.
Constraints :
0 <= N <= 10^2
1<=arr[i]<=10^3

Time Limit: 1 sec

SOLUTION:

MIN_VALUE = -2147483648
from sys import stdin


def secondLargestElement(arr, n):
    #Your code goes here
    if n == 0:
        return MIN_VALUE
    largest = arr[0]
    secondLargest = MIN_VALUE

    for i in range(n):
        if largest < arr[i]:
            secondLargest = largest
            largest = arr[i]
        elif secondLargest < arr[i] and arr[i] != largest:
            secondLargest = arr[i]
    return secondLargest
