Given a number N, figure out if it is a member of fibonacci series or not. Return true if the number is member of fibonacci series else false.
Note:
Fibonacci series is the series of numbers where each number is obtained by adding two previous numbers. The first two numbers in the Fibonacci series are 0 and 1.


Input Format :
Integer N
Output Format :
true or false
Constraints :
0 <= n <= 10^4
Sample Input 1 :
5
Sample Output 1 :
true
Sample Input 2 :
14
Sample Output 2 :
false

	 	* Return output and don't print it.
	 	* Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
